# A.S.T.R.O.COM. - Advanced Solar Tracking and Rover Observation Communication

The ASTROCOM project, developed in collaboration the [Florida Space Institute (FSI)](https://fsi.ucf.edu/), addresses the challenge of exploring permanently shaded regions on the lunar surface. Comprising heliostat and communication beacon towers, ASTROCOM enables wireless transmission of power and information to and from rovers within these shaded areas. The Heliostat tower utilize a reflector to redirect sunlight into the craters, powering solar assets and illuminating shaded regions, while also enabling a communication network. A portable communication beacon, intended to be deployed by rovers, a facilitate communication between the heliostat towers and rovers, overcoming obstacles within the craters.
